# Sentiment Tools Evaluation

This project evaluates 3 unsupervised sentiment analysis tools : VADERSentiment, TextBlob and IBM-Watson analyser using labelled data and classification metrics. The Classification metrics used were Confusion matrix, Accuracy score, Precison and Recall. Based on the metrics used, IBM-Watson had the highest score among the 3 analyzers. A Mode classifier was also initiated to see if it would surpass the analyzers. Its metrics scores were better than that of the VADERSentiment and TextBlob analyser but not as great as the IBM-Watson analyser

Here is the the Metrics table of all four methods
