This project evaluate 3 unsupervisied sentiment analysis tools : VADERSentiment, TextBlob and IBM-Watson analyser using labelled data and classification metrics. The Classification metrics used were Confusion matrix, Accuracy score, Precison and Recall. Based on the metrics used, IBM-Watson had the highest score among the 3 analyzers. A Mode classifier was alos initiated to see if it would surpass the analyzers. Its metrics scores was better than that of the VADERSentiment and TextBlob analyser but not as great as the IBM-Watson analyser
